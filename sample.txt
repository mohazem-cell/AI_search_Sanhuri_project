Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. 
AI has a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and predictive analytics. 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through language. 
It enables machines to read, understand, and generate human language. Common NLP applications include chatbots, sentiment analysis, and language translation. 

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows machines to improve their performance through experience without being explicitly programmed. 
ML algorithms can be supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement-based, depending on the type of data and the learning task.

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture used primarily in NLP. 
They rely on self-attention mechanisms to understand the context of words in a sequence, enabling state-of-the-art results in tasks like question answering and text generation.
